## FAQ

**How do hardware wallets actually protect cryptocurrency better than software wallets or exchange storage?**

Hardware wallets store private keys on specialized chips physically isolated from internet-connected computers. When you initiate transactions, the hardware device signs them internally without exposing keys to your potentially compromised computer. Exchanges control your private keys, making you vulnerable to platform hacks, exit scams, or seizures. Software wallets store keys on internet-connected devices exposed to malware. Hardware wallets eliminate these attack vectors through air-gapped or encrypted communication, requiring physical device access and PIN codes for unauthorized transactions. [Ledger](https://www.ledger.com) uses banking-grade Secure Element chips specifically designed to resist physical and remote tampering attempts.

**What happens if I lose my hardware wallet or it breaks—do I lose all my cryptocurrency forever?**

No, your crypto remains safe through recovery seed phrases generated during initial setup. These 12-24 word phrases mathematically reconstruct your private keys on replacement devices or compatible wallets. Write down your recovery phrase on paper, store it securely offline, and you can recover everything even if your hardware wallet gets destroyed, lost, or stolen. The phrase represents your actual wallet—the physical device simply provides secure access to it. However, anyone obtaining your recovery phrase controls your funds, so protect it like cash.

**Can hardware wallets handle all the cryptocurrencies I own or do I need multiple devices?**

Most modern hardware wallets support thousands of cryptocurrencies through native integration or third-party wallet software. Platforms like Ledger and Trezor handle Bitcoin, Ethereum, and virtually all major altcoins plus countless tokens built on popular blockchains. Bitcoin-focused options like Coldcard sacrifice altcoin support for enhanced Bitcoin security. Check specific device specifications before purchasing to confirm your holdings are supported. Many users own multiple hardware wallets for diversification—segregating assets across devices reduces single points of failure while providing backup options.
